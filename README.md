 The Project 
 
 This project is the last project in the Odin Projects Foundations curriculum. The goal was to make a basic calculator. It had to include rounded decimal places, the ability to do math with floating point numbers, add a backspace and allow the user to string together operands and operators. For example  12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = 42. Don't use eval()! My first attempt anded up making an expression string like a graphing calculator which caused a huge increase in difficulty.
 
 The Process
 
 1. I re-used functions for basic arithmetic from an earlier assignment from The Odin Project.
